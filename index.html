    <h3>Work Experience (Let's just mention the remarkable ones)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Selk Record Pressing - 2021/2024</h4></li>
            <p>The first ever tasks automated by (the one and only) Automatron 3000, were @ this chilean vinyl record factory, he joined the company not to automate things, but actually to get it off the horrendus situation in which it was at that moment. He manage to do so with great success, and in the meantime discovered the great world of Airtable which opened the doors of automations to him.</p>
            <p>Among some of the automated tools developed in these years let's mention:
                <ul>
                    <li>automated responses to leads</li>
                    <li>daily and monthly KPI reports to investors</li>
                    <li>pricing tools</li>
                    <li>updated operations monitoring</li>
                    <li>inventories controlling systems</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <li><h4>Self Employed - 2024/today</h4></li>
            <p>By the arrival of 2024, Automatron 3000 was blinks away from being created. In Febreuary, ##### left the vinyl factory in order to trouble to Europe with the idea of studying a psychology degree.</p>
            <p>Things didn't went as planned and ###### saw himself working as a butler in an asian restorant, he felt exploided and poorly treated and decided to do something about it. In July of that year he created three YouTube channels for Automatron 3000 in English, Spanish and PortuguÃªse, with the idea to upload Airtable and related platforms tutorials, crafting his skills and developing a portfolio to offer his services.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Focus Consultancy - MINEDUC Tutors Plan</b></li>
                    <p>
                        As if God had been waiting for him to take action into his current situation, days after the channels were created, he received an offer from Focus, one of the biggest consultancy companies in Chile, they were looking for somebody who were familiar with Airtable to work as a freelance in an educational project. ##### had an interview, programmed a ton that day and called back the following day to show what he had done, long story short he was now on the lead of this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project itself considered several tools;
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>back end and front end mobile apps</li>
                        <li>more than 20 different type of users with unique permissions and views of the front end</li>
                        <li>more than 50 type of forms</li>
                        <li>more than 1000 users along the entire country</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
        </ol>
